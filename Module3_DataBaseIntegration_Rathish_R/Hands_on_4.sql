Task 48: EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON

Query:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.course_name
FROM enrollments e
JOIN students s
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN courses c
    ON c.course_id = e.course_id
WHERE s.enrollment_year = 2022;


Task 49: Table Scan Analysis

The query plan shows:

students -> access_type = ALL
This indicates a Full Table Scan on the students table.

enrollments -> access_type = ref
Uses an index lookup.

courses -> access_type = eq_ref
Uses the primary key index.

Task 50: Rows Examined

Estimated rows examined:

students    : 100 rows
enrollments : 20 rows
courses     : 1 row

Observation:
A Full Table Scan occurs on the students table because MySQL scans all rows to find students with enrollment_year = 2022.
Creating an index on enrollment_year can improve performance.

Suggested Index:

CREATE INDEX idx_students_enrollment_year
ON students(enrollment_year);

Task 51:
CREATE INDEX idx_students_enrollment_year
ON students(enrollment_year);

Task 52:
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_enrollments_student_course
ON enrollments(student_id, course_id);

Task 53:
CREATE INDEX idx_courses_course_code
ON courses(course_code);

Task 54:
CREATE INDEX idx_enrollments_student_null_grade
ON enrollments(student_id)
WHERE grade IS NULL;

In the N+1 approach:

1 query is executed to fetch all enrollments.
